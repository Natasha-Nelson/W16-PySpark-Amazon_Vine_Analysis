# W16-PySpark-Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview:
The purpose of this analysis was to explore the potential impact Amazon's Vine program has on review scores. For this analysis, I worked with a dataset from the publically available data listed below:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt --> https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Tools_v1_00.tsv.gz

In this project, I worked with AWS RDS, AWS S3, PgAdmin/SQL, and PySpark/Google Colab. Using these tools, I explored the dataset above to understand whether participation in the vine program positive skews reviews.

## Results: 

How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
